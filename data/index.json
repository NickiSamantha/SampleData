        "title":"I am a 25-year-old mother of two, living in Retreat, Cape Town. I absolutely love my role as a mother and thrive in creative environments. During my time in the Call Center Customer Service industry, I developed an interest in the technical field, which led me to apply for a technical associate role. While working in this field, I discovered a passion for IT, particularly in coding and the hardware and software aspects of technology. Relocating is also on my checklist, as I would love to explore various parts of South Africa and the world while maintaining job security, especially since I have never been outside of Cape Town. I consider myself an ambivert; I enjoy my downtime but also love interacting with teams. This balance makes me an ideal team member who is also comfortable working independently."
